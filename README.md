# Viewer
This is a wxPython app that I am writing to use instead of 'JpegView' on Windows 10. Aside from displaying .jpg files that are dropped on the client area it will recurse through a dropped directory to build a view list. This can be viewed either randomly or sequently. The app should be platform neutral.
